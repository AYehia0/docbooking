# Docbooking

## The Flow
1. The doctor adds his availability slots (availability module)
2. The patient books an appointment (booking module)
3. The doctor confirms the appointment (confirmation module), then a notification is sent to the patient and the doctor
4. When the appointment is completed, the doctor marks it as completed (appointment module)
